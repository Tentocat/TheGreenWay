/*
 * This file contains macros to manipulate singly and doubly-linked lists.
 *
 * 1. LL_ macros:  singly-linked lists.
 * 2. DL_ macros:  doubly-linked lists.
 * 3. CDL_ macros: circular doubly-linked lists.
 *
 * To use singly-linked lists, your structure must have a "next" pointer.
 * To use doubly-linked lists, your structure must "prev" and "next" pointers.
 * Either way, the pointer to the head of the list must be initialized to NULL.
 *
 * ----------------.EXAMPLE -------------------------
 * struct item {
 *      int id;
 *      struct item *prev, *next;
 * }
 *
 * struct item *list = NULL:
 *
 * int main() {
 *      struct item *item;
 *      ... allocate and populate item ...
 *      DL_APPEND(list, item);
 * }
 * --------------------------------------------------
 *
 * For doubly-linked lists, the append and delete macros are O(1)
 * For singly-linked lists, append and delete are O(n) but prepend is O(1)
 * The sort macro is O(n log(n)) for all types of single/double/circular lists.
 */

/* These macros use decltype or the earlier __typeof GNU extension.
 As decltype is only available in newer compilers (VS2010 or gcc 4.3+
 when compiling c++ code), this code uses whatever method is needed
 or, for VS2008 where neither is available, uses casting workarounds. */
