/*
 The SetAssetFillamounts() and ValidateAssetRemainder() work in tandem to calculate the vouts for a fill and to validate the vouts, respectively.
 
 This pair of functions are critical to make sure the trading is correct and is the trickiest part of the assets contract.
 
 //vin.0: normal input
 //vin.1: unspendable.(vout.0 from buyoffer) buyTx.vout[0]
 //vin.2+: valid CC output satisfies buyoffer (*tx.vin[2])->nValue
 //vout.0: remaining amount of bid to unspendable
 //vout.1: vin.1 value to signer of vin.2
 //vout.2: vin.2 assetoshis to original pubkey
 //vout.3: CC output for assetoshis change (if any)
 //vout.4: normal output for change (if any)
 //vout.n-1: opreturn [EVAL_ASSETS] ['B'] [assetid] [remaining asset required] [origpubkey]
    ValidateAssetRemainder(remaining_price,tx.vout[0].nValue,nValue,tx.vout[1].nValue,tx.vout[2].nValue,totalunits);
 
 Yes, this is quite confusing...
 
 In ValidateAssetRemainder the naming convention is nValue is the coin/asset with the offer on the books and "units" is what it is being paid in. The high level check is to make sure we didnt lose any coins or assets, the harder to validate is the actual price paid as the "orderbook" is in terms of the combined nValue for the combined totalunits.
 
 We assume that the effective unit cost in the orderbook is valid and that that amount was paid and also that any remainder will be close enough
